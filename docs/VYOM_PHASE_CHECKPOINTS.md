# Vyom Phase Checkpoint Ledger

This file is the hand-off record across conversations. The repository code and CI are authoritative; this ledger points to the evidence and the next uncompleted task. Never restart a phase just because a new chat begins.

## Re-entry protocol (mandatory)

1. Read this ledger and `docs/VYOM_MIND_DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`.
2. Inspect the current `updated` branch head and newest GitHub Actions run for that exact SHA.
3. Read the target module and relevant tests; compare them with the phase checklist below.
4. Mark each acceptance item `implemented + tested`, `partial`, or `missing`. Search existing code/tests and commit history before proposing any change.
5. Implement only the first unmet acceptance item in dependency order. Do not recreate completed functionality in another module.
6. Update this ledger and roadmap in the same commit as the phase change. A phase is CI-verified only when the workflow for the same commit succeeds. A green CI does not claim real Windows/microphone validation unless that validation was actually performed.

## Checkpoint snapshot

- Branch: `updated`
- Verified M0.3 implementation: `3feb985aad0fe5c6c31c1be6189b7363f6a0d616`, [CI run 39399731304](https://github.com/snchat78-svg/Vyom/actions/runs/39399731304) succeeded with 299 passed and 12 subtests; EXE build/upload succeeded.
- Verified M0.4 implementation: `a499f3e61a30b7a5afb4ed3aacba47406c7fe06b`, [CI run 39400224264](https://github.com/snchat78-svg/Vyom/actions/runs/39400224264) succeeded with 300 passed and 12 subtests; Windows `Vyom.exe` built, verified and uploaded.
- M0.3 reuses existing M4 WorldState history and M5/M6 verification output; do not rebuild observers/verifiers.
- M0.4 routes typed and spoken turns through the same `ConversationManager` instance. The former direct text-to-executor bypass is covered by `tests/test_m0_4_shared_frontend.py`.
- M0.1–M0.4 are implemented and CI-tested at the listed source commits. The next task is an **M0 exit-gate audit only**, not another trace/pipeline implementation. Read the newest workflow for the exact current branch SHA first.

## Phase matrix

| Phase/checkpoint | Existing implementation and evidence | Status before M0.3 | Remaining acceptance |
|---|---|---|---|
| M0 baseline | Shared ConversationManager, canonical result schema, bounded history, no success-by-response-text inference | Partial | Whole shared pipeline trace and regression evidence |
| M0.1 input trace | `voice/voice_controller.py`, `ai_core/conversation_manager.py`, `tests/test_conversation_manager.py`; raw STT text, normalized input, confidence, corrections, result stage and verification status | Implemented + CI tested | Real Windows microphone/voice round-trip |
| M0.2 pipeline trace | `command_engine/executor.py`, `ai_core/conversation_manager.py`; trace ID, intent/route, compact goal-compilation/mission/context summaries and privacy tests | Implemented + CI tested | Observation events linked to the same trace |
| M0.3 observation correlation | Same-turn timestamped observations linked to trace ID; payload-free event summaries and no-observation state; validated by run 39399731304 | Implemented + CI tested | Real Windows observation behavior remains part of integration validation |
| M0.4 shared frontend | `ai_core/main.py`, `voice/voice_controller.py` and `tests/test_m0_4_shared_frontend.py`; same manager handles typed and spoken turns | Implemented + CI tested (run 39400224264) | Real Windows interactive acceptance remains pending |
| M1 noisy speech | `voice/command_normalizer.py` and its typo/ambiguity tests | Foundation + CI tests | Representative real microphone/accent benchmark |
| M2 meaning/intent | `command_engine/intent.py`, `ai_core/meaning_intent_engine.py` and ambiguity/context tests | Foundation + CI tests | Paraphrase/noisy voice validation, ask instead of guessing |
| M3 complex planning | `ai_core/goal_compiler.py`, `ai_core/mission_planner.py`, dependency-validation tests | Foundation + CI tests | Real multi-step Windows acceptance |
| M4 world state | M4.1–M4.6 documented in roadmap; `ai_core/world_state.py`, `tests/test_phase4_world_state.py` | Implemented automated guards; platform validation pending | Fresh active-window/focus behavior on user's Windows PC |
| M5 action grounding | M5.1–M5.5 documented in roadmap; UI grounder/verifier tests | Implemented automated guards; platform validation pending | Real controls, layouts and foreground changes |
| M6 execution/recovery | M6.1–M6.6 documented in roadmap; mission runtime, recovery tests and durable journal | Implemented automated guards; platform validation pending | Real delayed effects, restart, and side-effect validation |
| M7 web/source answers | Web knowledge and provider groundwork exist; roadmap acceptance gate not proven complete | Partial/planned | Source-backed fact retrieval and citation quality tests |
| M8 general reasoning | Provider/goal-routing groundwork exists; broad benchmark not complete | Partial/planned | Provider outage behavior and sourced/unknown answer evaluation |
| M9 opt-in learning | Skill/memory modules exist; safe user-approved end-to-end gate not established here | Partial/planned | Consent, provenance, expiry/export/deletion acceptance |
| M10 release evaluation | CI suite exists; representative full benchmark and real-device evidence are incomplete | Ongoing/incomplete | Metrics thresholds and Windows integration evidence |

## Current phase hand-off

M0.1–M0.4 are implemented and CI-tested at the source commits recorded above. The next task is the M0 exit-gate audit: compare each M0 acceptance bullet against existing source/tests, especially shared executor parity and the rule that an action must not be reported as verified without evidence. Do not implement another trace/observer or redo M0.1–M0.4. If automated gates are complete, record the remaining external Windows/microphone checks as platform validation—not as missing code.
